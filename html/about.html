                                <p>My name is Ellie Erickson. I was born and raised in Utah and have the most caring family and friends. I am attending school at Brigham Young University and attempting to study Accounting in the Marriott School of Business. I was also able to serve as a full time service missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Las Vegas, Nevada.</p>
                                <p>Traveling has been a big part of my life. Growing up, I had the amazing opportunity to live in Bangalore, India. I learned so much while living there, but I think my biggest lesson learned was the fact that family stays constant no matter where you live. One thing that I got to do while living there was some cultural dance. While here at BYU, I participate in one of the International Folk Dance teams, this has been such a great way to remind me about my time while living in India.  </p>
                                <p>
                                    One thing that is super important to me is my family. Everything we have done together has brought us closer together. They are silly, adventurous, loving, kind, thoughtful, and so much more.   
                                </p>
                                <p class="mb-0">
                                    A few places that we like to go as a family, that pretty much have defined my life, are my great-grandpa's ranch, Disneyland, and St. George. I have always said that my favorite state is Wyoming. My great-grandpa's ranch is located in Pinedale, Wyoming and this is where we go to celebrate Memorial Day and Labor Day almost every year. My grandparents on my dads side also both grew up in Starvalley, Wyoming. This past summer, we were able to go with them to the temple there and they showed us around their home town. It was really cool to hear all of their stories of what the world was like when they were growing up.</p>
